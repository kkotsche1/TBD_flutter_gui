This code was the frontend code of the winning team for the most impactfull award in the Merantix GenAI hackathon October 12th - 13th 2023. 

Our teams application (TBD) - aims at making technical health records more accessible to everybody. The app lets you take photos of your documents and get a simplified description back. If you are not familiar with the output language you can translate the letter to your preferred language. Not only that, but you can interact with the documents by asking questions about the content of the letter.

here a small demo of what the app can do: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZDgWtaHcMf7p8QkxOq0ArtZB1c8MZpYz/view?usp=share_link)

## Tech stack: ##

The application was powered by [firebase](https://firebase.google.com), with a [flutter](https://flutter.dev) front end and google cloud functions in the backend.
